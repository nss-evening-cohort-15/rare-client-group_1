                <p>Surround yourself with python angels. Eliptical talk. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and Iâ€™m never giving up, Iâ€™m just getting started. Always remember in the jungle thereâ€™s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, thatâ€™s the key, Lion! Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, thatâ€™s the key, Lion!</p>

                <p>Major key, donâ€™t fall for the trap, stay focused. Itâ€™s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. Bless up. They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. Letâ€™s see what Chef Dee got that they donâ€™t want us to eat. To be successful youâ€™ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, youâ€™ve got to make it. Stay focused.</p>

                <p>Howâ€™s business? Boomin. We the best. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. Letâ€™s see what Chef Dee got that they donâ€™t want us to eat. Life is what you make it, so letâ€™s make it. Stay focused. Letâ€™s see what Chef Dee got that they donâ€™t want us to eat. Mogul talk. To be successful youâ€™ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, youâ€™ve got to make it. Stay focused. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, itâ€™s a cold world out there.</p>
